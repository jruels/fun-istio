# Deploy multi-tier application
This lab shows you how to build, deploy and manage a simple, multi-tier web application using Kubernetes. 

We will be deploying the guestbook demo application which is made up of Redis master, Redis slave, and guestbook frontend.  After successfully deploying we will update the application and then rollback to the previous version.

## Enter working directory
Enter working directory:
```
cd $(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

## Clone the GitHub Repository
Use the Git tool to clone the repository with all the lab files:
```
git clone https://github.com/jruels/fun-istio.git
```
After the cloning the repo, enter the directory:
```
cd fun-istio/labs/05-multi/
```

## Start up Redis Master 
The guestbook application uses Redis to store its data. It writes data to a Redis master instance and reads data from multiple Redis slave instances.

### Creating the Redis Master Deployment 
The manifest file, included below, specifies a Deployment controller that runs a single replica Redis master Pod.

Apply the Redis Master deployment file 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-master-deployment.yaml
```

Verify the Redis master is running 
```
kubectl get pods
```
You should see something like: 
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-585798d8ff-s9qmr   1/1       Running   0          44s
```

Now let’s check the logs 
```
kubectl logs -f <POD NAME>
```

If everything looks good continue 

### Create the Redis Master Service 
The guestbook applications needs to communicate to the Redis master to write its data. You need to apply a Service to proxy the traffic to the Redis master Pod. A Service defines a policy to access the Pods.

Apply the Service 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-master-service.yaml
```

This manifest file creates a Service named redis-master with a set of labels that match the labels previously defined, so the Service routes network traffic to the Redis master Pod.

Confirm service is running 
```
kubectl get svc 
```

You should see running service 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    34m
redis-master   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP   56s
```

## Start up the Redis Slaves
Although the Redis master is a single pod, you can make it highly available to meet traffic demands by adding replica Redis slaves.

### Create Redis Slave Deployment 
Deployments scale based off of the configurations set in the manifest file. In this case, the Deployment object specifies two replicas.
If there are not any replicas running, this Deployment would start the two replicas on your container cluster. Conversely, if there are more than two replicas are running, it would scale down until two replicas are running.

Apply the Redis slave deployment 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-slave-deployment.yaml
```

Confirm it’s running successfully. 
```
kubectl get pods
```

You should now see the following 
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-585798d8ff-s9qmr   1/1       Running   0          6m
redis-slave-865486c9df-bf68k    1/1       Running   0          8s
redis-slave-865486c9df-btg6h    1/1       Running   0          8s
```

### Create Redis Slave service 
The guestbook application needs to communicate to Redis slaves to read data. To make the Redis slaves discoverable, you need to set up a Service. A Service provides transparent load balancing to a set of Pods.

Apply Redis Slave Service 
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/redis-slave-service.yaml
```

Confirm services are running 
```
kubectl get services
```

You should see: 
```
NAME           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
kubernetes     ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP    38m
redis-master   ClusterIP   10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP   5m
redis-slave    ClusterIP   10.98.54.128   <none>        6379/TCP   35s
```

## Setup and Expose the Guestbook Frontend 
The guestbook application has a web frontend serving the HTTP requests written in PHP. It is configured to connect to the `redis-master` Service for write requests and the `redis-slave` service for Read requests.

## Create the Guestbook Frontend Deployment
Apply the YAML file using the `--record` flag.
NOTE: We are using the `--record` flag to keep a history of the deployment, which enables us to rollback.
```
kubectl apply --record -f manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Now let’s verify they are running 
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

You should see something like this 
```
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-67f65745c-jwhdw   1/1       Running   0          27s
frontend-67f65745c-lxpxj   1/1       Running   0          27s
frontend-67f65745c-tsq9k   1/1       Running   0          27s
```

### Create the Frontend Service
The `redis-slave` and `redis-master` Services you applied are only accessible within the container cluster because the default type for a Service is `ClusterIP`. ClusterIP provides a single IP address for the set of Pods the Service is pointing to. This IP address is accessible only within the cluster.

If you want guests to be able to access your guestbook, you must configure the frontend Service to be externally visible, so a client can request the Service from outside the container cluster.

Apply the Frontend Service
```
kubectl apply -f manifests/frontend-service.yaml
```

Confirm the service is running 
```
kubectl get services
```

You should see something like this 
```
NAME           TYPE          CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
frontend       LoadBalancer  10.0.11.103    34.66.110.70  8081:30455/TCP 96s
kubernetes     ClusterIP     10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        44m
redis-master   ClusterIP     10.107.62.78   <none>        6379/TCP       11m
redis-slave    ClusterIP     10.98.54.128   <none>        6379/TCP       6m
```

### Viewing the Frontend Service 
To load the front end in a browser visit the EXTERNAL-IP from command above.

In the example above we can see that `frontend` Service is running on port 8081 so I would visit the following in a web browser 

`http://EXTERNAL_IP:8081`

## Scale Web Frontend 
Scaling up or down is easy because your servers are defined as a Service that uses a Deployment controller.

Run the following command to scale up the number of frontend Pods:
```
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=5
```

Now verify the Pods increased to specified number of replicas
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

To scale back down run 
```
kubectl scale deployment frontend --replicas=2
```

Now check to see if Pods are being destroyed 
```
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook -l tier=frontend
```

## Update frontend image

Confirm the version of the image you are using
```
kubectl describe deployment frontend |grep Image
```

You should see `v4`
```
Image:      gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v4
```

Now we are going to update our YAML file 
```
vim manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Replace `v4` with `v5` so it looks like below:
```
..snip
- name: php-redis
        image: gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend:v5
```

Now save the file and deploy the new version 
```
kubectl apply --record -f  manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

Run the following to see that the Pods are being updated
```
kubectl get pods -l tier=frontend
```

You should see some Pods being terminated and new Pods being created
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-56d4ff456b-jpdhk       0/1       ContainerCreating   0          0s
frontend-56d4ff456b-pv2m2       1/1       Running             0          9s
frontend-56d4ff456b-rbz5p       1/1       Running             0          19s
frontend-56f7975f44-fgxk8       1/1       Running             0          7m
frontend-56f7975f44-j76lw       1/1       Terminating         0          7m
redis-master-6b464554c8-jdxhk   1/1       Running             0          11m
redis-slave-b58dc4644-crbfs     1/1       Running             0          10m
redis-slave-b58dc4644-htwkm     1/1       Running             0          10m
```

Great!  Now you can confirm it updated to `v5`
```
kubectl describe deployment frontend | grep Image
```

Now that you're successfully running `v5`  update the YAML file to `v6` and deploy it.  Do not forget to use `--record`

After the update has completed confirm it is running `v6`
```
kubectl describe deployment frontend | grep Image
```

## Rollback deployment 
Now let's say that something went wrong during our update, and we need to rollback to a previous version of our application. 

As long as we used the `--record` option when deploying this is easy. 

Run the following to check the rollout history 
```
kubectl rollout history deployment frontend
```

```
REVISION  CHANGE-CAUSE
1         kubectl apply --record=true --filename=manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
2         kubectl apply --record=true --filename=manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
3         kubectl apply --record=true --filename=manifests/frontend-deployment.yaml
```

To see the changes made for each revision we can run the following, replacing `--revision` with the one you want to know more about
```
kubectl rollout history deployment frontend --revision=2
```

Now to rollback to our previous revision we can run: 
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment frontend
```

If we needed to choose a version previous to our last we can specify it:
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment frontend --to-revision=1
```

What does the rollout history look like now? 
```
kubectl rollout history deployment frontend
```

Remember when you rolled back the previous version it changed the order of deployment revisions. 

Use the following command to see details about each deployment revision, replacing `<number>` with the actual revision number.
```
kubectl rollout history deployment/frontend --revision=<number>
```

## Cleanup
To clean up everything run 
```
kubectl delete -f manifests/
```

Confirm everything was deleted 
```
kubectl get pods
```
